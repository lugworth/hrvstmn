# HRVSTMN (Next.js Edition)

An ASCII tribute to *Harvest Moon: Friends of Mineral Town*, rendered in the base16 Isotope Dark palette and rewritten as a high-performance **Next.js 15+ (App Router)** web application with React 19 and HTML5 Canvas.

## Features

- **Native Web Performance**: Rebuilt with pure TypeScript running directly in the browser—no WebAssembly/Pyodide download overhead, and no SharedArrayBuffer cross-origin isolation restrictions.
- **Complete Harvest Moon Gameplay**:
  - Full crop cycle: tilling, planting, watering, and harvesting 15 seasonal crops.
  - Animal husbandry: barns & coops with chickens, cows, and sheep (feeding, petting, brushing, milking, shearing).
  - Town & villagers: 18 NPCs with daily schedules, dialogue, heart levels, gift preferences, festivals, and marriage.
  - Mountain & Mines: forage wild herbs, bamboo shoots, mushrooms, and delve through 10 mine floors for ores and precious gems.
  - House expansions: carpentry upgrades (kitchen, extension, bathroom, big bed, coop expansion) and cooking with utensils and recipes.
  - Seasonal festivals: New Year's Day, Goddess Festival, Chicken Sumo, Egg Hunt, Fireworks, Harvest Festival, and more.
- **Controls**:
  - Keyboard: Arrow keys / WASD to move, Space / Z to use tool, X / E / Enter to interact, Tab / Shift+Tab to switch tools, I for rucksack, Esc for menu, ? for help.
  - Touch: Full on-screen D-Pad (with tap-or-hold repeat) and action buttons for mobile & tablet gameplay.
- **Auto-Save**: Farm progress, crops, animals, and relationships persist in your browser's local storage.
